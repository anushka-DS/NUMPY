   **NumPy** (short for Numerical Python) provides an efficient interface to store and operate on dense data buffers. In some ways, NumPy arrays are like Python's built-in list type, but NumPy arrays provide much more efficient storage and data operations as the arrays grow larger in size. 
   NumPy arrays form the core of nearly the entire ecosystem of data science tools in Python, so time spent learning to use NumPy effectively will be valuable no matter what aspect of data science interests you.
   
   Here are the top four benefits that NumPy can bring to your code:

**More speed:** NumPy uses algorithms written in C that complete in nanoseconds rather than seconds.
**Fewer loops:** NumPy helps you to reduce loops and keep from getting tangled up in iteration indices.
**Clearer code:** Without loops, your code will look more like the equations you’re trying to calculate.
**Better quality:** There are thousands of contributors working to keep NumPy fast, friendly, and bug free.

Because of these benefits, NumPy is the de facto standard for multidimensional arrays in Python data science, and many of the most popular libraries are built on top of it. Learning NumPy is a great way to set down a solid foundation as you expand your knowledge into more specific areas of data science.
